Hypothesis Statement:

"The presence and proportion of missing values in datasets have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of predictive models. This effect is more pronounced in deep learning models compared to traditional machine learning and statistical learning models. Specifically, as the proportion of missing values increases, the accuracy of all models will decrease, but deep learning models will exhibit a greater decline in performance due to their higher sensitivity to data quality issues."
